            <p class="bigBlue">Hey everyone! My name is Keiyon Tyler and I am going to share with you a portfolio of my current project! So a little bit about me: I was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina and have moved a total of eight times in my life! Something that I like to tell people just to see their facial reaction is that I have NEVER seen Star Wars before in my life.  Most of the time people are like, "Wow are you kidding me!" I am at the point in my life now where I can't ever see myself watching it. </p>
            <p class="bigBlue">I am a very active person.  In high school, the two sports that I participated in were wrestling and track.  I wrestled for eight years and made it to regionals my sophomore and junior year but I was unable to continue because I tore a labrum and then fully dislocated my right shoulder. Although this injury happened six years ago, I am now into weight lifting. Whenever my friend's see how much stronger I have become, they always wonder what kinds of foods am I consuming considering that I am a vegan.  </p>
            <p class="bigBlue">I graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University in December 2017 with a degree in Business: Administration.  Although I have a degree, I was not very passionate with the classes that I had to take while in this field.  I knew that it was a sign for me to look for better opportunities, which is why I signed up for this Bootcamp class.  I am having a lot of high expectations for this course as I have heard from a family friend that she learned a lot from this type of course and that she is finally happy with her current job.</p>
